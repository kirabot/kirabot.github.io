    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>civilization does not advance automatically. my work focuses on understanding the forces that drive civilizational progress, and on researching and building meta-technologies that sustain and accelerate it. alongside this broad mission, i remain committed to the human scale: art, design, music, sport, and engineering as essential forms of human expression. these practices ground my everyday life and inform my professional work.</p>
    <p>my specialty lies in assembling interdisciplinary teams of artists, engineers, designers, and other contributors, aligning them into functional groups that communicate across disciplines and produce diverse work.</p>
    <p>i divide my time between two complementary tracks:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong><a href="https://euclideanstudios.com/" target="_blank">euclidean studios</a></strong> — indie game development, where i co-lead <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1968940/Nazralath_The_Fallen_World/" target="_blank"><em>nazralath: the fallen world</em></a>.</li>
        <li><strong><a href="https://www.icrc.org/" target="_blank">international committee of the red cross (icrc)</a></strong> — <a href="https://virtual-reality.icrc.org/" target="_blank">virtual reality simulation work</a>, building training experiences for high-stakes humanitarian contexts, and supporting recruitment through interviews and local community outreach to grow an interdisciplinary team.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>i also served on the <strong><a href="https://sga.rs/" target="_blank">board of the serbian games association (sga)</a></strong> and participate in lectures, workshops, and strategy work for the regional games ecosystem.</p>
