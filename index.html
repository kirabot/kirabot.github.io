<div class="main_text">
  <p>Civilization doesn't advance on its own. I'm trying to deeply understand what causes civilizational progress, as well as research and build meta-technologies that would help with maintaining and accelerating our advancement.</p>
  <p>On a less grand scheme, I'm in love with Humanity and the things we make, do and consume, so to stay sane and maintain a sense of normalcy in everyday life, I play with art, music, sports, dances and engineering.</p>
  <p><a href="essays.html">Here's</a> an overview of the things I think about.</p>
  <p>And <a href="work.html">here's</a> a rundown of the things I've done and am doing.</p>
