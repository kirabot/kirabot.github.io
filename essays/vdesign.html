			The rules of business are fairly simple - provide a product or servicesuch that the market is willing to pay more for it than you spent toprovide it. This makes some types of businesses very easy, because alot of business is just doing things other people either don’t want todo, or can’t do.
		</p>

		<p>
			Sometimes a market is already filled with these types of businesses.In that case you have to either provide a product or service that’s insome way superior to everyone else’s, or you innovate and createsomething that nobody else has yet. Either of these can give you theedge you need. In the most difficult cases, you have to do both.
		</p>

		<p>
			Design in the broadest sense plays a large role in how good a productor service is. This is especially true when trying to stand out as thebest choice among many competitors.
		</p>

		<p>
			Spotify is a good example of this. There’s limited room to technicallyimprove the service of streaming music online. Boost the numbers ofavailable artists and tracks, try to get server reliability as closeto 100% as possible, and that’s pretty much it.
		</p>

		<p>
			Where it excels is user experience, which is boosted by bothengineering and visual design. On the engineering end, statistical andmachine learning models help users discover new music that they’relikely to enjoy. It’s also very snappy, music plays as soon as youpick
		</p>

		<p>
			Visually, the app follows all modern design principles. It’s sexy. Itfeels like a thousand dollars. The personalized reports and playlistsgive the impression that there’s a team of customer support people onthe other end, manually putting it together for you.
		</p>

		<p>
			Most of the value Spotify comes from its design. This is compared toe.g. Winamp, which provides the service of playing audio files, orDeezer, which provides the service of streaming music online.
		</p>

		<p>
			There’s not a meaningful way to quantify the effect good design has onproducts or services. The closest we have to it is some form of A/Btesting, from which we can see the results of design changes, thoughnot the effects themselves. Perhaps this is for the best.
		</p>

		<p>
			The bottom line is that there’s lots of businesses that are justwaiting for the proper designer to come and help solve them.
